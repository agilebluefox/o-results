## Design Steps

- Create rough draft of database schema
- Create project directory structure
- Add workflow files for npm, git, and gulp

- Code individual mongoose models for document types
- Write tests for each of the db models


## Test Queries

- the students in a class
- which students participated in an event
- which students ran a particular course
- can I retrieve a result for a student?
- retrieve the controls for a course in order
- sort the student result by time
